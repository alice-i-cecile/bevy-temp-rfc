# Feature Name: Accessibility

## Summary

Accessibility features are needed for applications and games. This RFC covers very high-level needs, and will probably require subsequent sub-rfcs to hash out the design details of the many potential accessibility features.

## Motivation

We have a ethical (and legal) imperitive to consider the needs of all end-users of the games and applications made with Bavy. To be used for anything more than toy projects, this is a requirement.

## Guide-level explanation

- TTS: Text-to-speech
- Color blindness modes
- Rebinding inputs

## Reference-level explanation

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks

It takes time and effort to develop these features.
